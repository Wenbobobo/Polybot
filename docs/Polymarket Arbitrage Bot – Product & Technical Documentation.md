## Introduction

**Project Overview:** We plan to build a **Polymarket arbitrage trading bot** that exploits pricing inefficiencies across prediction markets for consistent profit. The bot will primarily operate on **Polymarket**, the world’s largest crypto prediction market, and integrate other platforms like **Opinion Market** and **Manifold** to maximize arbitrage opportunities. Initially, the tool will be used privately (via a simple Telegram bot interface) and later expanded for broader use once proven stable and profitable.

**Arbitrage Strategies:** Our approach combines multiple arbitrage techniques: buying complete outcome sets below fair value, capturing bid-ask spreads, exploiting “yes/no” price discrepancies (negative risk arbitrage), reacting to news in real-time, and even **cross-market arbitrage** between different prediction platforms. Each strategy is grounded in the core principle of finding **mispriced odds** and executing offsetting trades such that profits are locked in regardless of the outcome. Importantly, all outcome shares on Polymarket are fully collateralized in USDC, meaning **every pair of “YES” and “NO” shares sums to $1**[_[1]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/what-is-polymarket#:~:text=,USDC%20each%20upon%20market%20resolution). This guarantees that holding one of each outcome share yields a $1 payout at resolution, forming the basis of risk-free arbitrage when combined cost is below $1.

**Technology Stack:** We will use **Python** as the primary language for development. Python is ideal due to its rich ecosystem of data analysis libraries and the availability of official Polymarket API client libraries in Python[_[2]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/clients#:~:text=Polymarket%20has%20implemented%20reference%20clients,use%20of%20the%20API%20below). The bot will connect to Polymarket’s API (and other platforms’ APIs) to fetch real-time market data, place orders, and manage positions. In the initial phase, a lightweight Telegram bot interface will allow us to monitor activity and control the bot with minimal overhead, keeping the system simple and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

**Goals and Roadmap:** Our end goal is to achieve a **fully automated arbitrage system** that can generate steady profits with minimal risk exposure. The development roadmap will proceed in stages: (1) **Multi-platform research & integration** – gather data and ensure API access to Polymarket, Opinion, Manifold, etc. (2) **Technical implementation & testing** – build the trading logic, order execution, and data pipelines; test in simulation and with small funds. (3) **Data analysis & modeling** – collect historical data to identify patterns, optimize strategies, and perform mathematical modeling. (4) **Risk management & optimization** – develop algorithms to allocate capital optimally across opportunities while limiting exposure (including worst-case “black swan” scenarios). (5) **Deployment & monitoring** – run the bot live on a small scale (private/closed group) via Telegram interface, evaluate performance (profits, win-rate) in real markets. If the strategy consistently yields profits (targeting the full lifecycle automation mentioned in step 4), we will then consider scaling up and offering the service to external users. Future monetization could come from **performance fees or spreads** captured when providing this arbitrage as a service (for example, by operating a **liquidity vault** that others can invest in, as discussed later).

## Arbitrage Strategy Components

Our arbitrage bot will implement several complementary strategies to capture different types of mispricings in prediction markets. Below we detail each major strategy and how the bot will execute them:

### 1. **Dutch Book (Multi-Outcome) Arbitrage**

This strategy targets markets with **multiple mutually exclusive outcomes** (e.g. price ranges, multiple candidates, etc.) where the **sum of all outcome probabilities is less than 100%**. In such cases, one can buy a **“full set” of outcomes** for a total cost < \$1 and lock in a risk-free payoff of \$1 when the event resolves[_[3]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=Dutch%E2%80%91book%20arbitrage%20happens%20when%20market,1%2C%20you%20make%20guaranteed%20profit)[_[4]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=,50). This is known as a **Dutch-book arbitrage**: if you can purchase one share of every possible outcome for under \$1 total, you are guaranteed \$1 back, yielding profit equal to $1 - (total cost)[_[3]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=Dutch%E2%80%91book%20arbitrage%20happens%20when%20market,1%2C%20you%20make%20guaranteed%20profit)[_[4]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=,50).

- **Example:** Suppose Polymarket offers a market on gold’s price by end of 2025 with multiple ranges: “\< \$4000” trading at \$0.35 (35%), “\$4000–\$4400” at \$0.15 (15%), etc. If the sum of prices for all ranges is \$0.80 (80%), our bot can buy shares in _every_ range for \$0.80 total. No matter what the actual price is, one of those shares will pay \$1 at resolution, giving a **guaranteed \$0.20 profit** (minus negligible blockchain fees). This profit is **risk-free assuming the outcome set covers all possibilities**. We must verify that the event covers the entire outcome space (including an “Other” or open-ended range if needed) – Polymarket’s **“negative risk” framework** ensures completeness by often including an “Other” outcome for unanticipated cases[_[5]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/neg-risk/overview#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20known%20issue,When%20a)[_[6]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/neg-risk/overview#:~:text=Polymarket%20UI%20will%20not%20show,naming%20conventions%20are%20as%20follows).
- **Black Swan Risk:** While this arbitrage is theoretically safe, we acknowledge “black swan” scenarios and rule nuances that could undermine the trade. For instance, if the outcomes don’t truly cover every possibility or if an unforeseen event causes the market to resolve ambiguously, a trader could be caught off-guard. An example highlighted by a Polymarket arbitrageur: _if a political candidate dies or is disqualified, a seemingly sure arbitrage across election markets could unravel_[_[7]_](https://jeremywhittaker.com/index.php/2024/09/24/arbitrage-in-polymarket-com/#:~:text=Read%20the%20Rules%20Carefully). We will **carefully read market resolution criteria** for each market to avoid hidden pitfalls. Our bot’s logic will include checks for any “Other” or placeholder outcomes (common in Polymarket’s augmented negative risk events[_[5]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/neg-risk/overview#:~:text=There%20is%20a%20known%20issue,When%20a)) to ensure that our “complete set” truly covers all outcomes. If any outcome is missing or rules are unclear, the bot will either avoid the trade or treat it as a **speculative (not risk-free) position** subject to risk limits.
- **Market Efficiency Consideration:** In practice, straightforward cases where outcome probabilities sum to \<100% are **rare and fleeting** on major platforms. High-frequency bots and sophisticated traders constantly scan for these obvious arbitrages and eliminate them within milliseconds[_[8]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=However%2C%20in%20an%20efficient%20market%2C,traders%20can%20even%20spot%20them). Indeed, a 2025 study found that bots on Polymarket aggressively exploit such mispricings – over one year, hundreds of users (likely automated) collectively extracted nearly \$40 million in arbitrage profits, often capturing tiny edges of 1–5% whenever they appeared[_[9]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=mispriced%20wagers%20to%20generate%20risk,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants)[_[10]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=Normally%2C%20the%20likelihood%20of%20all,free%20profits). This means our bot must be **fast and efficient** in identifying and acting on these opportunities. We will utilize Polymarket’s real-time data APIs and possibly websockets to continuously monitor probabilities across all markets, executing a basket purchase as soon as an inefficiency is detected. To improve speed, the bot can pre-fetch all active markets and compute probability sums offline (as suggested by a Polymarket arb guide[_[11]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=So%20you%20need%20to%20scan,that%20interrelate%20with%20each%20other)[_[12]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=pull%20all%20active%20events%20and,prices%20for%20everything%20at%20once)) rather than querying each market sequentially.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** When multiple Dutch book opportunities exist simultaneously, we will allocate capital to the best ones based on **expected ROI and time to resolution**. Short-term arbitrages with quick payout are attractive, but longer-term arbitrages with, say, a 3% return in a month (36% annualized) can also be worthwhile. The bot will calculate annualized return for each full-set arbitrage (e.g. a 2% profit with 2 weeks until resolution is ~52% annualized) and prioritize accordingly. If capital is limited, we’ll invest in the highest annualized ROI opportunities first, while also considering diversification across uncorrelated events to reduce any unforeseen risk.

### 2. **Bid-Ask Spread Capture (Market Making)**

This strategy involves acting as a **liquidity provider** on prediction market order books to earn the spread between buy and sell prices. Polymarket operates a **central limit order book (CLOB)** where each market has bids (offers to buy shares) and asks (offers to sell shares). The **spread** is the gap between the highest bid and lowest ask. For example, if the best bid for “Yes” shares is \$0.40 and the best ask is \$0.47, the **spread is \$0.07** (7 cents)[_[13]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/using-the-orderbook#:~:text=In%20this%20market%2C%20%E2%80%9CPresidential%20Election,to%20sell%20Trump%20Yes%20shares). Our bot can **place limit orders inside this spread** – for instance, post a buy at \$0.41 and a sell at \$0.46. If both orders execute, we’ll have bought at \$0.41 and sold at \$0.46, netting \$0.05 profit per share (before any fees). Since Polymarket **charges zero trading fees**[_[14]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/fees#:~:text=Trading%20Fees), capturing spreads is purely profit apart from gas costs.

- **Mechanics:** The bot will continuously monitor order books for wide spreads and place **paired orders** to exploit them. Using the above example, when the spread is \$0.07, we quote **both sides** slightly inside: a bid just above the current bid and an ask just below the current ask. We effectively become a market maker, providing liquidity to both buyers and sellers. If the market subsequently trades through our quotes (i.e. someone sells to our bid at \$0.41 and someone buys from our ask at \$0.46), we earn the spread. It’s important that we **maintain symmetry** – quoting both buy and sell – to remain delta-neutral (no directional bias). Our strategy is not to predict the event outcome, but to earn from trading frictions. We will use Polymarket’s API to place limit orders (either via REST endpoints or WebSocket as appropriate). Polymarket’s developer documentation even provides **“spreads” endpoints/utilities** to help calculate mid-market and ideal quoting points[_[15]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=Polymarket%20liquidity%20providers%20will%20be,Description%20%24order%20position%20scoring%20function)[_[16]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=c%20scaling%20factor%20%28currently%203,denominated%20quantity%20of%20ask), which we can leverage.
- **Risk and Mitigation:** Market making is not entirely risk-free – if the market moves sharply in one direction (e.g. due to news), our one side might get filled without the other, leaving us with an unhedged position. To mitigate this, the bot will employ **protective measures**:

·       Continuously update quotes based on the latest midpoint price and volatility. If, say, an important news update hits (detected via sudden price movement or an external news feed for sports/politics events), the bot will **pull outstanding orders** to avoid being caught offside.

·       Keep spreads sufficiently wide to compensate for risk. We will avoid quoting too tightly in very volatile markets. The bot can dynamically widen its quoted spread if the market starts swinging (this can be informed by measuring short-term volatility or order book imbalance).

- Use small order sizes relative to market depth. This limits the damage if one side executes and the market continues moving. We prefer many small trades to one large trade, for smoother inventory management.
- **Polymarket Liquidity Rewards:** An added incentive for this strategy is Polymarket’s **Liquidity Rewards program**. Polymarket publicly incentivizes market makers by awarding reward points (funded by the platform treasury) for posting tight, two-sided quotes[_[17]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=By%20posting%20resting%20limit%20orders%2C,this%20as%20creating%20incentives%20that)[_[18]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=This%20program%20is%20heavily%20inspired,addresses%20daily%20at%20midnight%20UTC). The reward formula (inspired by dYdX’s model) gives higher scores for orders that are **closer to the mid-price, on both buy and sell side, and of reasonable size**[_[19]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=Methodology)[_[20]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=Q_,denominated%20quantity%20of%20ask). Rewards are distributed daily to makers based on their share of total liquidity points on each market[_[21]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=depth%20function%20and%20reward%20amounts,addresses%20daily%20at%20midnight%20UTC). By providing **passive, balanced liquidity** (which our spread-capturing strategy inherently does), our bot can earn these extra rewards on top of the spread profits. While the documentation goes into complex equations, the takeaway is that our bot should quote **tight spreads around the midpoint** and maintain some depth to maximize reward points[_[15]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/rewards/overview#:~:text=Polymarket%20liquidity%20providers%20will%20be,Description%20%24order%20position%20scoring%20function). We will integrate a module to track our liquidity reward points via the Polymarket API (there’s an endpoint or method to check order reward scoring[_[22]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=binary%20limit%20order%20protocol%20contract,typescript%2C%20python%20and%20golang%20libraries)[_[23]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=Polymarket%E2%80%99s%20CLOB%20supports%203%20signature,funding%20Polymarket%20gnosis%20safe%20wallet)). These rewards likely come in the form of points or maybe future token/airdrop, but they effectively increase our ROI.
- **Example:** If currently the **Yes-order book** has a highest bid at \$0.40 and lowest ask at \$0.47, the bot might place a **buy (bid)** for Yes at \$0.41 and a **sell (ask)** for Yes at \$0.46. For the **No side** of the same market, recall that Yes and No shares sum to \$1.00, so a Yes price of \$0.46 corresponds to a No price of \$0.54. Instead of directly “selling Yes” at \$0.46, the bot could equivalently **place a buy for No at \$0.54** (buying No at 54¢ is the same as selling Yes at 46¢, since if Yes costs 46¢, No should cost 54¢ to sum to \$1). We ensure the orders correspond: quoting Yes-bid \$0.41 and No-bid \$0.54 simultaneously means if both fill, we bought Yes@0.41 and No@0.54. Owning one Yes + one No share for the market gives a full set that can be converted to \$1.00 – the conversion aspect is explained in the next section. In practice, the bot can quote in terms of either outcome; Polymarket’s API allows trading both **“YES” and “NO” order books separately**, but a buy on one side is logically a sell on the other. We will account for this duality in our order placement logic.

### 3. **“Yes/No” Conversions and Negative Risk Arbitrage**

This strategy leverages Polymarket’s **conditional token system** that allows conversion between outcome shares and the base collateral (USDC). As mentioned, one “Yes” and one “No” share together are worth \$1 at resolution, and **Polymarket allows merging a full set of shares back into USDC at any time**[_[24]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20splitting%20collateral,contract%20with%20the%20following%20parameters)[_[25]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=case.%20%2A%20%60conditionId%60%3A%20bytes32%20,amount%20of%20collateral%20to%20receive). This creates an arbitrage whenever we can acquire a Yes–No pair for less than \$1.

- **Two-Sided Order Placement (<50¢ each):** The most straightforward case is when both **Yes and No shares trade below \$0.50**. For example, if there are offers to sell Yes at \$0.46 and offers to sell No at \$0.46 (which implies Yes price \$0.46, No \$0.54 since they must sum to 1, but imagine a momentary order book situation or across two platforms). Our bot can **buy both Yes and No** at those prices. The total cost would be \$0.46 + \$0.54 = \$1.00 in this hypothetical – not an arbitrage in that exact case. But if the prices were Yes \$0.45 and No \$0.45 (sum \$0.90), buying both costs \$0.90. We can then instantly call Polymarket’s **mergePositions()** via the API to redeem one Yes + one No into \$1.00 USDC[_[24]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20splitting%20collateral,contract%20with%20the%20following%20parameters)[_[25]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=case.%20%2A%20%60conditionId%60%3A%20bytes32%20,amount%20of%20collateral%20to%20receive). This yields an immediate \$0.10 profit per pair, **locked in without any outcome risk**. Essentially, we identified a violation of the price parity (Yes+No < \$1) and corrected it by converting shares to the underlying stablecoin.
- **API Usage:** Polymarket’s API exposes this functionality in the **Conditional Token Framework** endpoints. We will use the **“Splitting”** and **“Merging”** calls as needed[_[24]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=In%20addition%20to%20splitting%20collateral,contract%20with%20the%20following%20parameters). Specifically, after buying shares, the bot will invoke the merge for the given condition ID, burning the full set of outcome tokens in exchange for USDC collateral[_[25]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CTF/merge#:~:text=case.%20%2A%20%60conditionId%60%3A%20bytes32%20,amount%20of%20collateral%20to%20receive). This requires an on-chain transaction, so our bot must have the Polygon wallet loaded and pay a small gas fee for the merge. We will monitor gas costs to ensure the arbitrage spread covers it. (On Polygon, fees are low, so even a few cents profit is viable.)
- **Earning Interest on Idle Collateral:** A key enhancement suggested in the plan is to put the arbitrage proceeds (USDC) to productive use if the event’s resolution is far in the future. Suppose the bot manages to buy Yes and No shares of a long-dated market (say an event resolving in 6 months) for a total of \$0.95. We have two choices: (a) merge immediately and get \$1, pocket \$0.05 profit now, or (b) hold the shares and redeem at resolution. Since Polymarket allows immediate merge, option (a) is usually better to lock profit. However, an alternative is to **merge into USDC now and then deposit that USDC into a yield-bearing vault**, effectively earning additional interest until closer to resolution. By doing this, we turn a static arbitrage profit into a **yield-generating strategy**. One opportunity is **Hyperliquid’s HLP Vault**, a DeFi vault that (as of 2025) offers ~15% APY on USDC[_[26]_](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/hyperliquid-hlp-vault-offers-15-usdc-yield-trading-insights-and-crypto-market-impact#:~:text=mentioned%20their%20increased%20engagement%20with,approximately%20%243%2C750%20during%20the%20same)[_[27]_](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/hyperliquid-hlp-vault-offers-15-usdc-yield-trading-insights-and-crypto-market-impact#:~:text=From%20a%20trading%20perspective%2C%20Hyperliquid%E2%80%99s,PERP%20alone%20accounting%20for) by using those funds for liquidity provision on a perpetual exchange. For example, Hyperliquid’s vault was cited to yield 15% as of May 2025[_[26]_](https://blockchain.news/flashnews/hyperliquid-hlp-vault-offers-15-usdc-yield-trading-insights-and-crypto-market-impact#:~:text=mentioned%20their%20increased%20engagement%20with,approximately%20%243%2C750%20during%20the%20same). Our plan (point 3.2) is to **integrate with Hyperliquid’s API or platform** so that whenever we accumulate spare USDC (from merging shares or idle capital), the bot can automatically deposit it into the vault. This way, even if we’re waiting for other arbitrages or just holding capital, it’s earning ~15% in the interim. At any time we need liquidity to execute a new trade, the bot can withdraw from the vault (most vaults allow on-demand withdrawal, though we’ll check for any lock-up or notice requirements). By doing this, the **arbitrage strategy’s ROI is boosted by the additional yield** on the collateral. Essentially, we treat the Hyperliquid vault interest as a second layer of arbitrage – risk-free interest on what is effectively risk-free arbitrage capital.
- **Risks and Considerations:** We must note that depositing in a third-party yield vault is not entirely without risk – for example, Hyperliquid’s vault returns depend on its internal trading strategies and there have been instances where vaults incurred losses (e.g. a trader on Hyperliquid caused a vault drawdown[_[28]_](https://hummingbot.org/blog/funding-rate-arbitrage-and-creating-vaults-on-hyperliquid/#:~:text=Hyperliquid%20Vaults%20serve%20as%20an,Vault%20Leader)[_[29]_](https://blog.mevx.io/news/trader-with-15m-left-hyperliquid-4m-in-debt#:~:text=How%20a%20Trader%20with%20Just,a%20%244M%20debt%20to)). We will treat the vault deposit as a _separate decision_. If the vault’s performance and risk profile are acceptable (15% APY with robust risk management as advertised[_[30]_](https://www.21shares.com/en-us/research/the-perpetual-dex-wars-hyperliquid-aster-and-lighter-in-focus#:~:text=The%20perpetual%20DEX%20wars%3A%20Hyperliquid%2C,peak%20liquidity%20exceeding%20%24500)), we will use it; otherwise, we could opt for safer yields (like lending USDC on Aave or a stablecoin farm with insurance). This part of the design will be handled carefully in the risk management module. Our default stance is that arbitrage funds should remain low-risk – so we will likely stick to **well-audited, highly secure yield platforms** for interest (and possibly diversify across a few). Hyperliquid’s vault is attractive for its high yield, but we will monitor its health metrics before committing large sums.
- **Polymarket Holding Rewards:** It’s worth mentioning that Polymarket itself introduced a **4% annualized holding reward** for certain long-term markets (like major elections) to incentivize liquidity in those markets[_[31]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=What%20are%20we%20doing%3F)[_[32]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=The%20current%20rate%20is%20set,at%20the%20time%20of%20evaluation). If our bot ever holds positions (Yes or No shares) in those eligible markets, we would earn 4% APY on the _position value_ (tracked hourly, paid daily)[_[33]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=Reward%20Rate%20and%20Conditions)[_[34]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=If%20you%20hold%20at%20time,of%20sample). However, in our strategy we typically wouldn’t “hold” an unhedged position just for 4% APY. The only time we hold shares is when we have both Yes and No (full hedge) – in that case, the holding reward is effectively risk-free and we could collect it. But since merging immediately yields the profit and frees up capital, we likely won’t leave full sets idle on Polymarket just to get 4%. The 15% off-platform yield vastly exceeds 4%. Still, we will keep this in mind: if for any reason it’s more convenient to hold the shares (perhaps to save gas of merging and re-splitting later), and the market is eligible, we’d get a small extra reward from Polymarket for holding[_[35]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=To%20keep%20long,click%20migration)[_[34]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/holding-rewards#:~:text=If%20you%20hold%20at%20time,of%20sample).

### 4. **Last-Minute “Sweeping” & News Arbitrage**

This strategy focuses on **late-stage markets and fast information reaction**: - **Sweeping the Closing Markets:** In the final moments before a market resolves (especially in sports or real-time events), prices can sometimes lag behind the true outcome. For example, in a sports match market, if one team clinches victory but the market odds haven’t yet moved to 100%–0% (perhaps due to low liquidity or slow reaction), there is an opportunity to “sweep” the order book – i.e., buy all available shares of the winning side at any price below \$1.00 because they will pay \$1.00 shortly. Our bot will integrate with **live data feeds** (e.g. sports API or news feeds) for events we trade. If we detect that an outcome is certain (game ended, official result declared) but Polymarket or Opinion’s market still has residual sellers at say $0.90, the bot will buy those shares up to \$1.00, making an instant profit (10¢ in this example). This requires extremely fast execution and awareness of **resolution criteria** (we must be sure the event is truly decided and that the platform will honor that outcome). Polymarket markets resolve via an Oracle (UMA’s Optimistic Oracle) after the event[_[36]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=How%20it%20works), so there may be a short delay, but once the outcome is locked, any price \< \$1 on the winner is essentially free money. Our bot will attempt to capitalize on these moments of **latency** between real-world resolution and market price convergence.

- **News Arbitrage:** Similarly, breaking news can cause rapid odds shifts. For instance, a sudden development in politics (a candidate dropping out, a surprise poll release, etc.) or in finance (an unexpected rate hike affecting a market on interest rates) can lead to **cross-market mispricing** or stale odds on one platform versus another. The bot will consume real-time news feeds or possibly social media (Twitter/X) alerts for key markets. One concrete plan is hooking into a **sports live text feed** for sports prediction markets. If, say, we have a market “Will Team A win?” and our feed indicates Team A just scored a decisive point in the final seconds, the probability should jump. If the market hasn’t adjusted yet, the bot can bet on Team A (Yes shares) before the odds update. This is more speculative (taking on event risk for a brief period) and not pure arbitrage unless we simultaneously short on another platform, but with a strong information edge, the **expected value** is positive. In a way, this is akin to _event-driven trading_, using the bot’s speed to beat human traders to the punch.
- **Market Scanning and Triggers:** We will implement a system of **“triggers”** for certain market types:

·       For sports, trigger on keywords like “touchdown”, “goal”, “red card”, or final whistle indicators in live commentary. When triggered, compare current market odds to expected new odds and bet accordingly.

·       For elections or political events, trigger on projected results or major news (e.g., “candidate X concedes” or a state is called in an election). If a platform’s market is slow to update (this can happen if liquidity is thin or traders are cautious), our bot’s quick action secures a better price. Notably, **Polymarket odds were heavily traded during the 2024 US election** and presumably fairly efficient[_[37]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=Blockchain,6%20billion), but even then there can be moments of extreme odds swings where spreads widen or some market lags behind others – fertile ground for our bot.

- We will likely maintain a **“watchlist”** of markets for which we have external data feeds. These will be configured manually (e.g., specific sports events we choose, or major award shows, weather events, etc., where reliable data is available).
- **Risk:** This approach carries inherent risk because it often involves taking a one-sided position quickly, and if our information or timing is wrong, it could result in a loss. It is essentially **speculative arbitrage** (not guaranteed). To manage this risk, we will:

·       Limit the stake sizes on these news-based bets relative to our confidence. Perhaps use a Kelly criterion or simpler fractional betting based on implied edge.

·       Wherever possible, **hedge on another platform**. For example, if Opinion Market also has the same event, we could buy on Polymarket while shorting on Opinion if one is slower – that leads into the next strategy, cross-market arbitrage.

Nonetheless, this strategy can be very lucrative. In prediction markets, _the informed, fast actors often reap rewards from the slower crowd_. By automating information ingestion, our bot aims to be among the fastest.

### 5. **Cross-Market Arbitrage (Polymarket vs. Opinion vs. Others)**

This strategy exploits price differences **for the same event across different platforms**. With new competitors like **Opinion Market** emerging, and other platforms (Manifold, Kalshi, etc.) in play, it’s possible to find situations where, say, Polymarket’s odds for an event diverge from Opinion’s odds. When two markets are effectively about the same underlying outcome, any significant price difference is an arbitrage opportunity: - If Platform A offers “Yes” at 40% for an event while Platform B offers 50% for the same “Yes”, a trader can **buy low on A and sell high on B**. In prediction markets, “selling high” can be done by **buying the “No” side** on B (or equivalently shorting Yes if that platform allows). By structuring the portfolio correctly, we lock in profit irrespective of the outcome: - For example, Polymarket “Yes” = \$0.40 and Opinion “Yes” = \$0.50. We could buy 100 Yes shares on Polymarket for \$40, and simultaneously _short_ 100 Yes shares on Opinion at \$0.50. Shorting Yes at \$0.50 on Opinion can be achieved by buying the “No” (which should cost ~\$0.50 as well if Yes is 50¢) on Opinion, or by another mechanism if Opinion allows direct short. Now consider outcomes: - If the outcome is Yes, our Polymarket position pays \$100 (100_$1), giving \$60 profit (since we paid \$40). Our Opinion No bet loses (we lose what we paid to short, which was \$50 in this example). Net outcome = \$60 - \$50 = \$10 profit. - If the outcome is No, our Polymarket Yes shares become worthless (we lose \$40), but our Opinion No bet pays \$100 (assuming we bought 100 “No” at 50¢). Profit on Opinion side = \$50 (since $100 payout minus $50 cost). Net outcome = \$50 - \$40 = \$10 profit. - In both cases, \$10 profit on \$90 total outlay – arbitrage achieved (~11% return instantly). We ignore fees for now (Polymarket has none; we should check Opinion’s fee model, likely also zero or minimal). This example illustrates the classic cross-market arbitrage where_ _Yes_A + No_B_* are purchased for under \$1 combined.

- **Target Platforms:** We will integrate at minimum **Opinion Market** and **Manifold** for cross-market comparisons. **Opinion Market** (brand name “Opinion” by Opinion Labs) is a newly launched decentralized prediction market on BNB Chain that in October 2025 briefly surpassed Polymarket’s volume[_[38]_](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251027A02YI400#:~:text=PANews%2010%E6%9C%8827%E6%97%A5%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%AEDune%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%EF%BC%8COpinion%E5%9C%A810%E6%9C%8825%E6%97%A5%E7%9F%AD%E6%9A%82%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E5%90%8E%E5%8D%95%E6%97%A5%E6%88%90%E4%BA%A4%E9%A2%9D%E8%BE%BE1)[_[39]_](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251027A02YI400#:~:text=PANews%2010%E6%9C%8827%E6%97%A5%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%AEDune%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%EF%BC%8COpinion%E5%9C%A810%E6%9C%8825%E6%97%A5%E7%9F%AD%E6%9A%82%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E5%90%8E%E5%8D%95%E6%97%A5%E6%88%90%E4%BA%A4%E9%A2%9D%E8%BE%BE1). Opinion markets run a similar CLOB model and have the same concept of shares in outcomes[_[40]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=What%20is%20Opinion%20Market%3F)[_[41]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=Opinion%20Market%20operates%20by%20allowing,weighted%20voting). According to their documentation, Opinion allows markets using any ERC-20 token as currency and uses a **consensus oracle with optimistic dispute resolution** for outcomes[_[40]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=What%20is%20Opinion%20Market%3F)[_[42]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=time%20prediction%20shares%2C%20supporting%20both,weighted%20voting). For our purposes, we will likely focus on markets using a stablecoin (perhaps BUSD or USDT on BNB Chain) so that payoffs mirror Polymarket’s USDC structure, making calculation easier. Opinion currently has a **points farming incentive** (no token yet, but users farm points for a future airdrop)[_[43]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=As%20of%20April%202025%2C%20Opinion,a%20potential%20upcoming%20token%20airdrop)[_[44]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=Opinion%20Market%20has%20announced%20the,and%20events%20into%20tradable%20assets) – this has led to a surge in activity, though some volume may be wash trading for rewards[_[45]_](https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31569684072273#:~:text=%E6%96%B0%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF%E7%9A%84%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E5%B9%B3%E5%8F%B0Opinion%E7%9C%9F%E7%9A%84%E6%98%AF%E5%BC%80%E9%97%A8%E7%BA%A2%2C%E5%8D%95%E6%97%A5%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E9%87%8F%E5%B1%85%E7%84%B6%E8%B6%85%E8%BF%87%E4%BA%86%E8%80%81%E7%89%8C%E9%A2%84%E6%B5%8B%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BAPolymarket%E3%80%82%E8%A6%81%E7%9F%A5%E9%81%93Polymarket%E5%8F%AF%E6%98%AF%E8%BF%99%E4%B8%AA%E8%B5%9B%E9%81%93%E7%9A%84%E9%BE%99%E5%A4%B4%E8%80%81%E5%A4%A7%2COpin%20ion%E8%83%BD%E5%9C%A8%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E5%A4%A9%E5%B0%B1%E8%B6%85%E8%BF%87%E5%AE%83%2C%E7%A1%AE%E5%AE%9E%E6%8C%BA%E9%9C%87%E6%92%BC%E7%9A%84%E3%80%82). Regardless, if Opinion lists markets similar to Polymarket (e.g., popular crypto prices, elections, sports), we’ll have an arbitrage opportunity whenever their odds differ. We will need to account for **transaction costs between platforms** (Polymarket on Polygon, Opinion on BNB Chain) – practically, we need capital allocated on each platform in advance, since transferring USDC between chains to arbitrage in real-time is too slow. So the bot will manage a **float on each platform**.
- **Other Platforms:** **Manifold Markets** is a play-money (or play-money + some real integration) platform where outcomes are usually traded in their virtual currency (M$). Direct arbitrage with Manifold is tricky since M$ is not freely convertible 1:1 with USDC (though users can sometimes buy M$ or tip, it’s mostly a closed economy). However, Manifold’s odds could be used as a **signal**. For instance, if Manifold’s community predicts something at 60% while Polymarket is 50%, and if we have reason to trust the wisdom of Manifold’s crowd or insider info, that discrepancy might indicate a value bet on Polymarket. But it’s not a true arbitrage because we can’t profit from the difference directly (unless Manifold had an avenue to convert M$ profit to real money, which it generally doesn’t except by selling to other users at a discount unofficially). Therefore, we will treat **Manifold integration mainly as data input** – our system can fetch Manifold odds via their API (they provide a public REST API[_[46]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=In%20your%20terminal%3A)[_[47]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=curl%20%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.manifold.markets%2Fv0%2Fbet%22%20,i95HLfK9N6hu5H7orfNj) and even historical data dumps[_[48]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=Trade%20history%20dumps)). This can enrich our models (e.g., identify when Polymarket lags behind Manifold on news, etc.). For actual arbitrage execution, the main cross-market pairs will be **Polymarket vs. Opinion**, and possibly vs. **Kalshi** for certain events (Kalshi is a CFTC-regulated US platform). Kalshi has an API and data, but bot trading on Kalshi would require an account and possibly US residency (which might be a roadblock depending on our jurisdiction). We will research this in the background but focus on the **crypto-native platforms first**.
- **Implementation:** The bot will subscribe to price updates from all integrated platforms. We may run a **unified order book monitor** that at any moment knows, for each event of interest, the best Yes price and best No price on each platform. When it spots a cross-platform mismatch, it triggers the execution module to place simultaneous orders. Achieving atomic arbitrage across two separate platforms is impossible (there’s always a lag on one), but we can mitigate risk by **choosing liquid markets** and **executing rapidly**. For example, if Polymarket has an ask at 40¢ and Opinion’s bid is 42¢ for the same outcome, we can buy on Polymarket and immediately sell on Opinion. The short time in between could be a risk if price moves, but since we’re providing liquidity (selling into an existing bid on Opinion), the execution is basically instant on both sides. We’ll need to handle each platform’s API calls and authentication separately:

·       Polymarket: use their Python CLOB client for trading[_[49]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/clients#:~:text=pip%20install%20py).

·       Opinion: likely will provide an API; if not documented publicly yet, we might interact with its smart contracts directly via web3.py or await an official SDK. (Opinion being new, we’ll keep an eye on dev resources or ask in their community for integration guidance.)

- Manifold: use REST API for fetching prices; for trading (if ever needed), they allow API key auth and HTTP POST for placing bets[_[50]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=,and%20generate%20a%20new%20one)[_[51]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=,and%20generate%20a%20new%20one).
- **Monitoring and Fail-safes:** Cross-market arbitrage introduces **execution risk** – one side trade might fail or one market may suddenly suspend trading (e.g., if event is resolved or halted). Our bot must have fail-safe logic: if one leg executes and the other fails, the bot should immediately try to exit the filled leg at market price, even if that incurs a small loss, to avoid being exposed. Additionally, differences in market liquidity mean we might only get a partial fill on one side. We will incorporate size-based adjustments: possibly **pro-rate our orders** to the side with less depth. If Opinion has only \$500 of liquidity at the target price but Polymarket has \$1000, we limit to \$500 each to ensure full matching.

In summary, **cross-market arbitrage broadens our profit scope** beyond any single platform’s inefficiencies, and ensures that competition between platforms actually works to our advantage. By being active on multiple venues, the bot can route capital to where the best odds are. As Opinion Market grows (backed by Binance’s incubator and others)[_[43]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=As%20of%20April%202025%2C%20Opinion,a%20potential%20upcoming%20token%20airdrop), we expect more such opportunities. In fact, on its launch, Opinion’s volume spike was largely driven by aggressive trading incentives[_[52]_](https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31569684072273#:~:text=%E6%8D%AE%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%98%BE%E7%A4%BA%2COpinion%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF%E5%90%8E%E4%BB%85%E4%B8%A4%E4%B8%AA%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%86%85%2C%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E9%87%8F%E5%B0%B1%E7%AA%81%E7%A0%B4%E4%BA%861) – this kind of environment could produce price discrepancies that our neutral arbitrage can exploit (while others chase airdrops, we chase guaranteed spreads).

### 6. **Liquidity Vault Strategy (Long-Term Market Making)**

In the long run, once the bot’s strategies are refined and consistently profitable, we envision setting up a **“liquidity vault”** – essentially a pool of capital dedicated to market making in prediction markets, where outside users can invest and earn a share of the profits. This was hinted in the plan as becoming the **counterparty to users’ bets**. The idea parallels a sportsbook’s role, except instead of taking directional bets, our vault systematically takes the opposite side of whatever the average (losing) user does, **earning the edge over time**. There is evidence that in prediction markets, _most casual users lose money_ to more informed or faster traders[_[53]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=,the%20most%20popular%20for%20arbitrage)[_[9]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=mispriced%20wagers%20to%20generate%20risk,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants). Our arbitrage bot is exactly the type of “smart money” that has been extracting millions in profit from Polymarket users[_[54]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=Copy%20link)[_[9]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=mispriced%20wagers%20to%20generate%20risk,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants). By scaling up with a vault, we can amplify these earnings.

- **Function:** The vault would deploy capital across many markets, always balancing the book to be arbitrage or edge-positive. For example, it could continuously post two-sided orders (like strategy #2) on a wide range of markets, essentially acting as the house. With sufficient capital, it can absorb bets from users and hedge any major exposures. Because we expect to earn the liquidity rewards and the inherent edge from spreads/mispricings, the vault should yield positive returns. Polymarket’s own data suggests that the **top market-making bots achieved multi-million dollar profits in a year**[_[55]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=The%20amount%20extracted%20through%20these,the%20bets%20going%20against%20them)[_[56]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=The%20top%20three%20wallets%20the,is%20conducted%20through%20automated%20programmes). Our vault would aim to replicate this at scale.
- **Technical Implementation:** This is a phase beyond the initial bot. It would involve:

·       A robust backend (likely still in Python or possibly a faster language if needed) that can manage **hundreds of markets** concurrently (the user’s plan mentioned “multi trading pairs <100, all buy” which we interpret as handling many markets up to 100 simultaneously).

·       Risk management layer to prevent the vault from over-concentrating (e.g., not to put all money on one event’s both sides because of potential dispute or unforeseen risk).

·       Possibly smart contract integration if we allow users to deposit funds and withdraw. For trust minimization, we could deploy a smart contract on Polygon where users deposit USDC, and our bot (as the vault manager) uses those funds via a trading smart contract or through a multi-sig controlled account to market-make on Polymarket. This is complex, but doable – similar to how Hyperliquid vaults work (they use an on-chain vault that the trader can draw from for exchange trading[_[28]_](https://hummingbot.org/blog/funding-rate-arbitrage-and-creating-vaults-on-hyperliquid/#:~:text=Hyperliquid%20Vaults%20serve%20as%20an,Vault%20Leader)[_[57]_](https://blog.mevx.io/news/trader-with-15m-left-hyperliquid-4m-in-debt#:~:text=On%20March%2012%2C%202025%2C%20a,a%20%244M%20debt%20to)).

- Performance fee: As an incentive, we could take a percentage of profit (like 10-20%) as the vault operator, while the rest goes to liquidity providers. This is analogous to Hyperliquid vaults where the vault leader takes 10% of profits[_[58]_](https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1iea2pr/a_newbie_here_are_vault_funds_locked_can_they_be/#:~:text=A%20newbie%20here%20,Profit%20for%20a%20vault%20investment).
- **Current Status:** Initially, we will **not open this to external users** until we have a proven track record. The first goal is “self-use or small circle” as stated. But it’s good to design the system with scalability in mind. If/when we reach this stage, we will incorporate thorough monitoring, auditing, and perhaps third-party code review to ensure everything is secure and as advertised.
- **Why Vault Will Likely Win:** In traditional betting, “the house” typically wins over time due to built-in edge. In prediction markets, there’s no house taking vig, but there are **systematic advantages for liquidity providers and arbitrageurs**. The average user often trades on tilt, chases losses, or acts on stale information. Our vault bot does the opposite – disciplined, fast, and exploiting any edge. As noted earlier, researchers observed that a few bot-like accounts on Polymarket reaped outsized profits by arbitraging mispriced odds[_[53]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=,the%20most%20popular%20for%20arbitrage)[_[9]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=mispriced%20wagers%20to%20generate%20risk,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants). By essentially **being the omnipresent market maker**, we position ourselves to earn from every mistake or impatience of other traders. The Polymarket liquidity rewards and holding rewards also tip the scales in favor of those providing capital. Thus, a large well-run vault could become a consistently profitable “market utility,” akin to being the top liquidity provider in every market.

In summary, the liquidity vault concept is a **future expansion** of our arbitrage bot into a full-fledged service/product. It aligns with the notion of eventually promoting the tool and perhaps charging fees. It would also synergize with strategy #3.2: instead of putting spare USDC into someone else’s vault (Hyperliquid), we could even create our own stablecoin yield strategy within our vault (though Hyperliquid’s 15% from external markets is still attractive to utilize). We will revisit this after proving the core strategies.

## Platform Integration and API Considerations

To implement the above strategies, we must interface with multiple platforms. Here we detail the key platforms, their APIs, and any usage conditions or constraints:

### Polymarket Integration

Polymarket is our primary platform and the bot’s core will revolve around it. Key points: - **Network and Collateral:** Polymarket operates on **Polygon (Matic) network** and uses **USDC** as the currency for all markets[_[1]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/what-is-polymarket#:~:text=,USDC%20each%20upon%20market%20resolution). We will maintain a Polygon wallet funded with USDC (and MATIC for gas) for the bot. Polymarket does not require KYC for non-U.S. users; sign-up can be done with just an email or a crypto wallet connect[_[59]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/get-started/how-to-signup#:~:text=Email%20or%20Google%20Sign). (We should ensure we abide by any geo-restrictions – Polymarket geoblocks US IPs due to regulatory concerns, but being based in Taiwan this likely isn’t an issue.) - **API Access:** Polymarket provides a comprehensive **REST API and WebSocket API** for developers[_[60]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/FAQ/does-polymarket-have-an-api#:~:text=Getting%20data%20from%20Polymarket). They have a service called **Gamma API** for market data (prices, volumes, metadata) at https://gamma-api.polymarket.com[_[61]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/gamma-markets-api/overview#:~:text=Polymarket%27s%20Gamma%20service%20indexes%20market,api.polymarket.com). And for trading, they use a **Relayer API** with the CLOB (Central Limit Order Book) interface. The documentation shows that Polymarket has open-source client libraries: - **Python Client:** The py-clob-client available on GitHub/pip helps handle order signing and submission[_[2]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/clients#:~:text=Polymarket%20has%20implemented%20reference%20clients,use%20of%20the%20API%20below)[_[49]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/clients#:~:text=pip%20install%20py). - **Authentication:** If using an email sign-up (magic link), one would use a signature via the proxy wallet. But since we control our own keys, we’ll likely use a normal EOA (Externally Owned Account) with private key to sign orders. The Python client allows initializing with an EOA signer (signature type 0)[_[62]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=Signature%20Types). We will load our private key into the bot (with careful security, possibly using environment variables or a secure vault in code). - **Rate Limits:** Polymarket’s API has rate limits (the docs mention checking API Rate Limits section[_[63]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/quickstart/introduction/main#:~:text=,Endpoints)). We need to ensure our bot’s request frequency (especially if monitoring hundreds of markets) stays within allowed limits or use websockets for streaming updates to reduce polling. - **Order Execution:** All orders are limit orders signed and submitted to the relayer[_[64]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=All%20orders%20are%20expressed%20as,typescript%2C%20python%20and%20golang%20libraries). The relayer/operator matches orders off-chain and then settles on-chain. We must set **allowances** for USDC and for outcome tokens for our wallet in the smart contracts[_[65]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=Allowances) – meaning our bot will on initialization make an on-chain transaction to approve the Polymarket exchange contract to spend our USDC (for buys) and to spend our outcome tokens (for sells). After that, trading is seamless. The Polymarket API and library handle the heavy lifting of hashing and EIP-712 signing of orders[_[64]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=All%20orders%20are%20expressed%20as,typescript%2C%20python%20and%20golang%20libraries)[_[23]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/CLOB/orders/orders#:~:text=Polymarket%E2%80%99s%20CLOB%20supports%203%20signature,funding%20Polymarket%20gnosis%20safe%20wallet). - **Data Retrieval:** We will use the Gamma API to fetch all markets and prices. For instance, the bot might regularly call an endpoint to get all active events and their markets (Polymarket provides events with nested markets in JSON[_[11]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=So%20you%20need%20to%20scan,that%20interrelate%20with%20each%20other)[_[12]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=pull%20all%20active%20events%20and,prices%20for%20everything%20at%20once)). This can be filtered by criteria (the example in a Medium post shows filtering events by end date or volume)[_[66]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=,DD)[_[67]_](https://medium.com/@wanguolin/how-to-programmatically-identify-arbitrage-opportunities-on-polymarket-and-why-i-built-a-portfolio-23d803d6a74b#:~:text=%22end_date_max%22%3A%20end_date_max_after_49_days.strftime%28%22%25Y,49%20days). We will likely pull the full order book for certain markets to analyze spreads – Polymarket’s API has an orderbook endpoint as well (perhaps under the “CLOB Requests” -> Orderbook section). - **WebSocket:** For real-time reaction (especially for strategy 4, news arbitrage), we’ll use Polymarket’s WebSocket feeds. The documentation has a **Market Channel** that streams live order book updates and trades[_[68]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/quickstart/introduction/main#:~:text=). By subscribing to the relevant market channels, our bot can get tick-by-tick updates with minimal latency, which is crucial for HFT-style arbitrage. We will handle the async event loop in Python (likely using asyncio and websockets library or the one provided by Polymarket). - **Usage Conditions:** Polymarket has **no trading fees**[_[14]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/polymarket-learn/trading/fees#:~:text=Trading%20Fees) as noted, which is highly favorable for us. It means we can do high volume churn. We do need to be mindful of **blockchain gas fees** on Polygon, though these are usually fractions of a cent per order thanks to Polygon’s low costs. If our bot is extremely active (e.g., canceling and replacing orders frequently), those gas costs add up, but should still be minor relative to profits if strategies are sound. - **Potential Issues:** The main external dependency risk on Polymarket side could be **liquidity** – if Polymarket’s user activity dips or certain markets are very illiquid, our bot might not find enough trading partners. But given Polymarket’s track record (over \$500M volume in 2024 around the election)[_[69]_](https://www.finfeedapi.com/products/prediction-markets-api#:~:text=Prediction%20Markets%20API%20,regulated%20Kalshi%2C%20and%20more)[_[37]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=Blockchain,6%20billion), there’s ample action in popular markets. We should avoid extremely obscure markets or ones marked as “experimental”.

### Opinion Market Integration

Opinion Market (developed by Opinion Labs) is a new platform (launched Oct 2025) on **BNB Chain**. It is **permissionless and decentralized**, aiming to allow anyone to create prediction markets with any tokens[_[40]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=What%20is%20Opinion%20Market%3F)[_[41]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=Opinion%20Market%20operates%20by%20allowing,weighted%20voting). For integration: - **Access & Accounts:** Currently, Opinion is in early access – it launched with a whitelist and a “week0” incentive program[_[70]_](https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31569684072273#:~:text=%E6%8D%AE%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%98%BE%E7%A4%BA%2COpinion%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%8A%E7%BA%BF%E5%90%8E%E4%BB%85%E4%B8%A4%E4%B8%AA%E5%B0%8F%E6%97%B6%E5%86%85%2C%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E9%87%8F%E5%B0%B1%E7%AA%81%E7%A0%B4%E4%BA%861). We will need to obtain access (if it’s still gated, we might join their Discord or follow their invite process). Assuming it opens up, we’ll create a wallet on BNB Chain for the bot. We might use the same physical machine but a different private key for BNB chain operations (best practice to separate Polygon vs BNB funds). - **API or Contracts:** As of writing, official API docs for Opinion are not yet public like Polymarket’s. We might have to interface directly with the **smart contracts** or a community-provided SDK. Given that Opinion also uses a CLOB, it likely has a relayer or on-chain order book. If on-chain order book, interacting might be expensive (BNB chain fees) and slow. More likely, they also run an off-chain matching engine. We will research if Opinion has a developer portal. (The Bitget info page summarizing Opinion didn’t list an API, but highlighted the mechanics[_[71]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=Opinion%20Market%20is%20a%20decentralized,chain).) - **Trading & Collateral:** Opinion allows any ERC-20 token as collateral, but to simplify arbitrage with Polymarket, we’ll focus on stablecoins on Opinion as well. Possibly they might use BUSD or a USDt/USDC on BSC. The bot will need to handle conversions if the collateral differs (e.g., Polymarket uses USDC on Polygon, Opinion might use BUSD on BSC – the exchange rate is 1:1 but funds are on different chains). This again means we keep separate pots of stablecoins on each chain. - **Incentives and Fees:** To attract users, Opinion may not charge fees initially (to be confirmed). It also has a **Points Farming** system[_[43]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=As%20of%20April%202025%2C%20Opinion,a%20potential%20upcoming%20token%20airdrop), meaning our trading might earn points that could convert to a future $OP (hypothetical token) airdrop. If so, that’s a bonus, though not guaranteed. We will track any such points if applicable. We must also consider that some of Opinion’s volume was likely **inflated by farming**[_[72]_](https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/square/post/31569684072273#:~:text=%E5%90%8E%E4%B8%BB%E8%A6%81%E6%98%AF%E6%97%A9%E6%9C%9F%E6%BF%80%E5%8A%B1%E5%9C%A8%E8%B5%B7%E4%BD%9C%E7%94%A8%2C%E9%A6%96%E6%89%B9%E5%8F%82%E4%B8%8E%E7%94%A8%E6%88%B7%E8%83%BD%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E6%89%80%E8%B0%93%E7%9A%84week0%E6%BF%80%E5%8A%B1%E5%88%86%E9%85%8D%E3%80%82), so actual liquidity when incentives normalize might drop. Our bot will adapt if volumes on Opinion dip – focusing on only sufficiently liquid markets for safe arbitrage. - **Integration Challenges:** The big one is **latency and reliability**. We will be running cross-chain operations. We cannot atomically trade between Polygon and BNB; we rely on executing two transactions (one on each platform’s relayer). If one fails, our bot’s error handling (as discussed) will kick in to unwind the other. We should also incorporate **platform health checks** – e.g., if Opinion’s API/relayer is down or very slow at any moment, the bot should possibly pause cross-market arbitrage to avoid one-sided execution. Similarly, if network congestion on BNB or Polygon spikes, transaction confirmation might slow down. We could mitigate by prefunding and using off-chain order books (since actual settlement happens when orders match, not on every trade). - **Regulatory/Usage Note:** Opinion Labs was supported by Binance Labs (now YZi Labs)[_[43]_](https://web3.bitget.com/de/dapp/opinion-market-29696#:~:text=As%20of%20April%202025%2C%20Opinion,a%20potential%20upcoming%20token%20airdrop) and launched on BNB chain, which suggests they target a similar global audience. We should ensure our usage is within their terms. Being decentralized, likely there’s no restriction unless using certain tokens. We will remain within allowed tokens (stables, etc.) and avoid any market that might be sensitive.

In short, integrating Opinion is a priority for the cross-platform edge, and we will do so as soon as access and documentation allow. Early metrics showed Opinion briefly overtook Polymarket’s daily volume[_[38]_](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20251027A02YI400#:~:text=PANews%2010%E6%9C%8827%E6%97%A5%E6%B6%88%E6%81%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%8D%AEDune%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%EF%BC%8COpinion%E5%9C%A810%E6%9C%8825%E6%97%A5%E7%9F%AD%E6%9A%82%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE%E5%90%8E%E5%8D%95%E6%97%A5%E6%88%90%E4%BA%A4%E9%A2%9D%E8%BE%BE1), meaning arbitrage between them could be very fruitful if that volume is in overlapping markets.

### Manifold Markets Integration

Manifold Markets is a popular prediction market platform with a different model: - **Currency:** Primarily uses **Play Money (“Mana” or M$)** and an automated market maker (AMM) model. Users buy shares from a pool, which adjusts odds. Manifold does have a feature where users can bet with real money via an intermediary (by buying Mana), but it’s not a straightforward real-currency market. - **API:** Manifold provides an open **REST API** (api.manifold.markets). Developers can fetch markets, odds, and even place bets using API keys[_[50]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=,and%20generate%20a%20new%20one)[_[51]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=,and%20generate%20a%20new%20one). We will generate an API key from our account for any interactions that require auth (like placing a bet)[_[73]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=APIs%20that%20require%20authentication%20accept,in%20one%20of%20two%20formats). For simply reading market data (probabilities), no auth is needed for endpoints like /v0/markets[_[46]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=In%20your%20terminal%3A). - **Usage in our Bot:** As discussed, direct arbitrage with Manifold for profit is limited due to the currency barrier. However, we will: - **Fetch data**: Include Manifold odds in our data aggregator. This could be especially useful for events that Polymarket or Opinion haven’t listed yet (Manifold has thousands of user-created markets, sometimes on niche or early topics). If our bot sees, for example, a Manifold market on “Bitcoin price > \$50k by Dec 2025” trading at 70%, and Polymarket has a similar market at 60%, that’s a clue. We might take a position on Polymarket expecting it to correct towards 70% (though that’s speculative). Alternatively, if both have markets, it’s a candidate for cross-platform – but since we can’t _short_ on Manifold with real money, we might just bet on the cheaper side on Polymarket and leave the Manifold side as informational. - **Testing ground**: We can use Manifold’s play-money environment to test some strategies in a risk-free way. For instance, we could simulate our market-making algorithm on a Manifold market (Manifold’s API allows automated betting, so we could create a bot there that continually buys and sells to mimic order book quotes). This won’t earn us real money, but could validate our algorithms and provide data on outcomes. - **Rate Limits and Reliability:** Manifold’s API has a generous rate limit (500 requests/min per IP)[_[74]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=Feel%20free%20to%20use%20the,addresses%20to%20circumvent%20this%20limit) which is more than enough. The API is still labeled alpha[_[75]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=), so we’ll implement error handling for if endpoints change. They are also open-source, so we can monitor their updates on GitHub. - **No fees:** Manifold doesn’t have fees for betting; instead they profit by selling Mana or via donations. So we don’t worry about transaction fees there either (except a tiny fee for API-placed comments as noted[_[76]_](https://docs.manifold.markets/api#:~:text=Fees), but we likely won’t post comments).

In conclusion, Manifold will be a supplemental integration – useful for data and strategy validation. Our core arbitrages will revolve around **Polymarket and Opinion (and possibly others like Kalshi if accessible)** where real-money profits can be made.

## Risk Management and Optimization Algorithms

Despite aiming for “risk-free” trades, our overall system faces various risks: execution risk, smart contract risk, market rule risk, etc. We also have limited capital which must be optimally allocated among opportunities. This calls for a robust risk management framework and optimization algorithms to guide the bot’s decisions.

### Risk Management

**1. Scenario Analysis:** We will model different _outcome scenarios_ for each set of positions the bot takes. For a true arbitrage (like full outcome set purchase or matched Yes/No across platforms), **worst-case profit is ≥0 by construction**. But for near-arbitrage or edge strategies (like news trading or some hedged bets), there is a small chance of loss. We will calculate **payoff matrices** for each strategy: - For Dutch book arbitrage, verify that at least one outcome yields profit and none yield loss (if sum < \$1, this holds). - For cross-market trades, ensure both outcome cases yield a non-negative result (taking into account any platform fees or rounding). - If any strategy yields a potential loss in a scenario (like the “Trump win vs popular vote hedge” example in the blog had a tiny gap where the hedge wasn’t perfect[_[77]_](https://jeremywhittaker.com/index.php/2024/09/24/arbitrage-in-polymarket-com/#:~:text=presidency)), we quantify that and decide if it’s acceptable as a **very low probability event**. Perhaps we avoid non-perfect hedges unless the probability of the “gap scenario” is exceedingly low (e.g., a candidate winning without popular vote is a known possibility, so maybe not risk it unless odds are strongly in our favor).

**2. Black Swan Checks:** As mentioned, always read market rules. The bot will maintain a list of known **exclusions or special cases**. For example, if a market has a rule “void if X happens”, and we cannot hedge X, we might skip that market for full-stake arbitrage. Also, negative risk markets (with “Other” outcome) – our bot will avoid trading the placeholder “Other” since its meaning can change[_[78]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/neg-risk/overview#:~:text=made%20complete%20by%20deploying%20all,named%20outcomes%2C%20and%20the%20other). It will stick to named outcomes to prevent unforeseen dilution of our positions.

**3. Execution Risk Mitigation:** We already plan immediate cancel strategies if one leg of a cross-market trade executes without the other. Additionally: - We might integrate with a **trade simulator** or dry-run mode where the bot simulates fills first. However, in live markets that’s not always predictive. Instead, we focus on making each trade atomic in concept: e.g., on Polymarket we could use **batch order placement** (Polymarket’s API supports placing multiple orders in one call[_[79]_](https://docs.polymarket.com/quickstart/introduction/main#:~:text=,Cancel%20Orders%28s)). But cross-platform atomicity isn’t possible; we accept a tiny window of risk. - Use **good-till-cancel vs immediate-or-cancel** orders appropriately. On Polymarket, we can place limit orders that rest (for market making). For arbitrage we might prefer immediate execution (taking existing liquidity). The Python client likely has a parameter for order time-in-force. We’ll use **fill-or-kill** style when we need to ensure partial fills don’t leave us hanging (or handle partial by adjusting size).

**4. Smart Contract and Platform Risk:** We keep funds mostly on two platforms (Polymarket and Opinion) and perhaps in Hyperliquid vault. That diversifies a bit but also introduces risk of contract bugs or hacks. Polymarket has been running for years without incident, and Opinion is new (we should start with smaller funds there until trust builds). We might mitigate by not keeping _all_ capital on-contract at all times: withdraw profits periodically to cold storage. Also maintain insurance funds (maybe allocate a portion of profits to a reserve for covering any unexpected loss).

**5. Stop-Loss and Exposure Limits:** For non-guaranteed bets (like if we do news-based directional bet or an imperfect hedge), we will implement a notional **exposure cap**. E.g., “do not risk more than X% of total capital on any single outcome or event.” This ensures a single shock doesn’t wipe us. We can also have a global stop trigger: if our net portfolio drops by a certain threshold, the bot can temporarily halt and send an alert on Telegram for human intervention. Since many of our strategies are near-riskless, we don’t expect large drawdowns, but it’s prudent to plan for extreme outliers.

### Optimization Algorithms

We intend to mathematically model the portfolio optimization problem and use solvers or algorithms to maximize profit subject to constraints (risk, capital, etc.). Some approaches: - **Linear Programming (LP):** Many arbitrages can be formulated as linear relationships. For example, deciding how much to bet on each outcome in a Dutch book to maximize profit given capital can be an LP. If sum of prices < 1, the trivial solution is to bet as much as possible (subject to your capital or market liquidity limits). But if we have dozens of opportunities, LP can allocate capital to the mix of bets that yields the highest return. Constraints could include capital usage, risk <= 0 (for each scenario), etc. We might set up an LP that each decision variable is amount to invest in arbitrage i, with constraints ensuring we don’t exceed available USDC on each platform and ensuring for any event outcome combination, the net payoff ≥ 0 (ensuring no net loss scenarios). - **Integer Programming:** If some decisions are discrete (e.g., either do an arbitrage or not due to indivisibilities, or if we have to choose a subset because of time constraints), we might add binary decision variables. But likely we can treat amounts as continuous (in dollars) for allocation purposes. - **Quadratic or Nonlinear Programming:** Not expected unless we incorporate probabilistic optimization (like maximize expected utility). But since we focus on arbitrage, we treat things mostly in a deterministic way (profit guaranteed or not). For partially risky strategies, we could incorporate an expected value vs variance trade-off. Perhaps maximize expected profit minus a penalty * risk. This could become quadratic if variance is considered. However, initially, a simpler approach is to set hard risk constraints and maximize expected value linearly.

- **Hedging Optimization:** In cross-market or multi-market arbitrage, sometimes there are multiple ways to hedge. For example, Jeremy Whittaker’s blog showed hedging a Trump bet with two Democratic outcomes[_[77]_](https://jeremywhittaker.com/index.php/2024/09/24/arbitrage-in-polymarket-com/#:~:text=presidency). Our algorithm could consider all combinations of positions that satisfy the hedge constraints and pick the one with the best profit. This is essentially solving a system of equations: e.g., find weights ![](data:image/png;base64,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) for bets such that outcomes either yield equal payoff or at least 0, and maximize the sum of weights * (payout - cost). We can solve that by linear methods or brute force small combinations.
- **Real-time Optimization:** The optimization needs to run in real-time or near-real-time as odds change. We won’t solve a huge LP from scratch every millisecond, but we can periodically recalc best allocations. In practice, simple greed (take the best immediate arb) might be enough given low risk. But if capital is a binding constraint, a more holistic allocation is needed. We’ll likely schedule an optimization pass every few minutes to redistribute capital if needed (e.g., if new big arbitrage opens up, shift funds).
- **Resource Allocation:** Another optimization problem is how much to allocate to **market making vs arbitrage vs vault**. This is like portfolio allocation. If pure arbitrages are available, those yield immediate risk-free profit and should be taken as priority. If there’s leftover capital, allocate to market making (which yields spread + rewards, but has some inventory risk). If even more leftover or temporarily no trades, allocate to yield farming. We can set target proportions or use dynamic programming to maximize overall APY.

### Performance Monitoring and Learning

Once live, we’ll keep detailed logs of every trade, outcome, profit, and error. This data can feed back into improving our risk model: - We might identify that certain markets or times of day have higher profit opportunities. We can then optimize the bot’s focus (e.g., around certain news cycles). - If any losses occur, analyze why – was it rule misinterpretation? execution delay? Then refine code or rules to avoid repetition. - Over time, we can incorporate a **machine learning model** to predict which arbitrages are likely to remain open longer or which spreads are “safe” to quote, etc., making the bot smarter. Initially, the rules-based approach is enough given the clear structure of arbitrage.

In summary, risk management and optimization are at the heart of making this arbitrage bot profitable **in the real world, not just on paper**. We will start with a conservative approach: only engage in mathematically sound arbitrages or very small-risk plays, and gradually expand once confidence and capital grow. The optimization algorithms will ensure we get the most out of our capital – for instance, always being invested in the best available edge – while the risk controls ensure we **never bet the farm on a bad day**.

## Development Roadmap and Deployment

To bring all these pieces together, here is our planned development roadmap with milestones:

1. **Research & Design (Current Stage):** We have gathered documentation on Polymarket’s API and mechanics, explored Opinion Market’s concept and early performance, and reviewed Manifold’s API. We also researched case studies of successful arbitrage on Polymarket (bots that made \$40M[_[54]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=Copy%20link)[_[9]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=mispriced%20wagers%20to%20generate%20risk,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants), and community code like Whittaker’s) to guide our design. This document itself is a product of that research, specifying how each strategy will work and be implemented.
2. **Prototype Development:**

3.      _Data Fetching Module:_ Implement scripts to pull market data from Polymarket (Gamma API for all markets and maybe The Graph as a backup) and from Manifold (REST API). Also set up a basic feed reader for news (could be as simple as monitoring a few RSS feeds or using a sports API).

4.      _Trading Module:_ Using Polymarket’s py-clob-client, attempt a test trade on a low-stakes market (perhaps a small buy and sell to see end-to-end). Ensure order placement, cancellation, and retrieval (get order status) work as expected. Do the same on Manifold with a test account for placing a bet via API (small M$ amount).

5.      _No actual Opinion trading yet_ (if not open) – but prepare a wrapper that could interact with BNB Chain via web3, so that when ready, we can plug in contract addresses and ABIs for Opinion’s markets.

By end of this stage, we should have a **functional bot skeleton** that can connect to APIs, fetch data, and simulate an arbitrage decision (e.g., log “Arbitrage found: buy X on Polymarket, Y on Manifold” even if we don’t execute it yet).

1.      **Testing & Simulation:** Before risking real money, we will simulate the strategies:

2.      Use historical data (Polymarket publishes a lot of trading data on Dune and the researchers provided datasets[_[80]_](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/markets/polymarket-users-lost-millions-of-dollars-to-bot-like-bettors-over-the-past-year/#:~:text=The%20group%20analysed%2086%20million,the%20expense%20of%20other%20participants)) to backtest how often arbitrages occurred and what profit could be made.

3.      Possibly run the bot in “shadow mode” during a live event (e.g., a sports game) where it prints what it _would_ do, and then afterwards we check if that would have been profitable. This is important for the news arbitrage component.

4.      Evaluate performance: measure latency from data update to decision to order placement. We might profile the code to ensure nothing is too slow (if Python becomes a bottleneck, consider Cython or moving critical loops to C++ – though likely not needed initially).

5. Security test: ensure API keys (like Manifold’s) and private keys are stored securely and not printed in logs. Also test error recovery: disconnect internet and see if bot resumes gracefully, etc.
6. **Initial Deployment (Private Beta):** Deploy the bot with a small amount of capital on Polymarket (and some on Opinion once accessible). This will be a **trial run with real funds** but limited scope:

7.      Perhaps focus on one or two strategies first (for example, pure Dutch book arbitrage and simple spread capture on one or two markets) to see real profits.

8.      Use the Telegram bot interface to receive alerts of actions and maybe to manually approve certain high-value trades at the beginning. The Telegram Bot will be set up via Bot API, sending messages like “Arbitrage found: +\$X expected. Executing…done.” and allowing simple commands like /status to report current holdings and P/L.

9. Run through at least one full event cycle (e.g., an event resolves and we collect payout) to ensure everything from trading to merging tokens to withdrawing works.
10. **Iteration and Scaling:** Based on the trial, fix any issues (e.g., missed opportunities due to lag, any losing trades and why). Gradually **increase capital** and enable more strategies concurrently. At this point, the bot could handle dozens of markets, placing many small orders. We’ll scale up hardware if needed (perhaps run on a server with low latency to Polygon and BNB endpoints). We will also integrate the Hyperliquid vault deposit/withdraw if we see unutilized USDC sitting for periods.
11. **Full Automation and Monitoring:** Once we are confident in the bot’s performance, it will operate 24/7 with minimal human intervention. We’ll set up monitoring: automated alerts on unusual behavior (e.g., if the bot’s holdings are not delta-neutral when they should be, or if P/L deviates beyond expected ranges). Logging will be thorough for audit trails.
12. **Expansion and Promotion:** With a stable system and proven profit (hopefully consistently beating, say, a benchmark of ~10-20%+ ROI monthly, considering arbitrage should yield small but steady returns), we can consider inviting trusted peers to contribute capital or use the service. This might mean implementing the **liquidity vault** smart contract and a web dashboard where users can deposit USDC to share in the returns. We’d also consider fee structures (maybe a performance fee or a small cut of profits). Promotion would highlight the bot’s track record, the value proposition (earning yield from prediction market inefficiencies), and our technical/security robustness. This phase would also involve ensuring compliance with any laws (since running a pooled fund or “vault” might have legal implications, albeit it’s a DeFi context).

Throughout all these phases, **comprehensive documentation** (like this document) will be maintained and updated. This includes both product documentation (what the bot does, for potential users or investors) and technical documentation (for developers or auditors to understand the inner workings). All significant findings from the research, such as Polymarket’s rules, Opinion’s mechanics, etc., are cited for transparency and to assist future maintainers in verifying our information sources.

Finally, the success of this project will be measured by the bot’s ability to consistently generate **risk-adjusted returns** higher than simple alternatives (like just lending USDC at 5-15%). Given the numerous angles we plan to exploit – **outcome mispricings, spread income, interest yield, cross-market gaps** – the outlook is promising. If any part underperforms, we will iterate or drop it, focusing on what works best. The end vision is an **autonomous arbitrage engine** that not only profits for its operators but also contributes to market efficiency (by arbitraging, we actually help align odds across platforms and tighten spreads, benefiting the ecosystem – all while earning our share for providing that service).

With careful execution and ongoing adaptation, we aim to turn the plan outlined here into a robust, profit-generating reality in the prediction markets arena.
